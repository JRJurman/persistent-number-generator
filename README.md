## Persistent Numbers

Inspired by Numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ

## Dependencies
* numpy

## Usage
```bash
python per.py <start> <steps>
```

Example:
```bash
python per.py 3 1
```

This will process all the numbers that are one step away from 3 (that is, their digits multiply to give you 3)

## Testing
There is pretty exhaustive unit testing, the files are adjacent to their source and cover a good chunk of the possible interfaces.
